Interpolation of a given data set by Lagrange and Newton polynomials

Polynomial interpolation is the interpolation of a given data set by the polynomial of lowest possible degree that passes through the points of the dataset.  
This program contains a class for a basic polynomial with all mathematical operators implemented and friend classes for Lagrange and Newton polynomials.  
It uses given data set, or a "net" of values, to create polynomials of different types to construct new data points within the range of the set of known data points.  
Then, Horner's method is used in order to evaluate found polynomials at given points.
